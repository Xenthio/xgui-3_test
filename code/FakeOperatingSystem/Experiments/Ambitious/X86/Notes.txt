NOTEPAD.exe doesn't run due to issue with opcode 83, where its meant to run 83 7C 24 10 24, 
but instead, something happens where it skips the first half of the next instruction, 7D and then complains about missing opcode 0A
problematic code is: 83 7C 24 10 24 7D 0A (you can see the 7D 0A is the next instruction)

similarly CALC.exe doesn't run due to issue with opcode 0F, where its meant to run 0F B7 45 EC,
but instead, something happens where it skips the first two bytes of the next instruction, B9 00, and then complains about missing opcode 04
problematic code is: 0F B7 45 EC B9 00 04 00 00 (you can see the B9 00 04 00 00 is the next instruction)
